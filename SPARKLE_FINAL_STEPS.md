## 🔑 Step 1: Generate Signing Keys (5 minutes)

### Download Sparkle Tools:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
curl -L https://github.com/sparkle-project/Sparkle/releases/download/2.5.2/Sparkle-2.5.2.tar.xz -o Sparkle.tar.xz
tar -xf Sparkle.tar.xz
cd Sparkle-2.5.2
```

### Generate Keys:

```bash
./bin/generate_keys
```

### Output will look like:
```
A key has been generated and saved in your keychain (in the login keychain).

Public key:
ABC123DEF456GHI789...YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE...XYZ

Private key:
PQR456STU789VWX012...YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE...123

IMPORTANT: Keep your private key secure and never commit it to version control!
```

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Save Keys Securely (2 minutes)

### Public Key:
1. Copy the **entire public key** (long base64 string)
2. Open `Nawawi/Info.plist`
3. Find: `<string>SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY_PLACEHOLDER</string>`
4. Replace with your public key

### Private Key:
1. **CRITICAL**: Save to 1Password/secure vault
2. Create note: "Nawawi Sparkle Private Key"
3. Paste the entire private key
4. **NEVER** commit this to git!

---

## 📝 Step 3: Update Info.plist (1 minute)

```xml
<!-- Before: -->
<key>SUPublicEDKey</key>
<string>SPARKLE_PUBLIC_KEY_PLACEHOLDER</string>

<!-- After: -->
<key>SUPublicEDKey</key>
<string>YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE</string>
```

### Then commit:
```bash
git add Nawawi/Info.plist
git commit -m "Add Sparkle public key for update signing"
git push origin main
```

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Host appcast.xml (2 minutes)

### Option 1: GitHub (Recommended - Already Set Up!)

The appcast.xml is already in your repo. Just need to push it to root:

```bash
# Copy to repo root
cp appcast.xml ../../
cd ../../

# Commit and push
git add appcast.xml
git commit -m "Add Sparkle appcast feed"
git push origin main
```

**Your feed URL (already in Info.plist):**
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hurshidbey/NawawiApp/main/appcast.xml`

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Test Update Check (1 minute)

1. Launch your app
2. Click menu bar icon
3. Click Settings (gear icon)
4. Scroll to "Updates" section
5. Click **"Check for Updates..."**
6. Should show: "You're up to date!"

**Why?** Because appcast.xml points to v1.0.0, same as your current version.

---

## 📦 When You're Ready to Release v1.0.0

### Build Release:
```bash
xcodebuild -project Nawawi.xcodeproj \
  -scheme Nawawi \
  -configuration Release \
  clean build

cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Nawawi-*/Build/Products/Release/
```

### Create ZIP:
```bash
ditto -c -k --keepParent Nawawi.app Nawawi-1.0.0.zip
ls -l Nawawi-1.0.0.zip  # Note the file size
```

### Sign ZIP:
```bash
~/Downloads/Sparkle-2.5.2/bin/sign_update Nawawi-1.0.0.zip
```

This outputs: `EdSignature: ABC123...signature...XYZ`

### Update appcast.xml:
```xml
<enclosure
    url="https://github.com/hurshidbey/NawawiApp/releases/download/v1.0.0/Nawawi-1.0.0.zip"
    length="FILE_SIZE_IN_BYTES"
    sparkle:edSignature="ABC123...signature...XYZ"
/>
```

### Upload to GitHub Releases:
1. Go to: https://github.com/hurshidbey/NawawiApp/releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `Version 1.0.0`
5. Upload `Nawawi-1.0.0.zip`
6. Publish!

## 🧪 Testing the Full Update Flow

### To test that updates actually work:

1. **Release v1.0.0** (current version)
2. Make a small change (e.g., change version to 1.0.1)
3. Build, ZIP, and sign v1.0.1
4. Upload to GitHub Releases
5. Update appcast.xml with v1.0.1 info
6. Push appcast.xml to GitHub
7. In running v1.0.0 app, click "Check for Updates"
8. Should see: "A new version (1.0.1) is available!"
9. Click "Install and Relaunch"
10. App updates automatically! 🎉

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Check for Updates" does nothing:
- Check Console.app for Sparkle logs
- Verify feed URL is accessible: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hurshidbey/NawawiApp/main/appcast.xml
- Ensure appcast.xml is valid XML

### "Unable to check for updates":
- Make sure Sparkle is initialized (check console for "✅ Sparkle updater initialized")
- Restart app

### Update signature invalid:
- Make sure public key in Info.plist matches private key used for signing
- Re-sign the ZIP with correct private key

---

## 📊 What You've Accomplished

You now have:
- ✅ Professional auto-update system
- ✅ One-click updates for users
- ✅ Secure cryptographic signing
- ✅ GitHub-hosted update feed (free!)
- ✅ Automatic daily update checks

This is the same update system used by:
- **Sketch**
- **Transmit**
- **Hundreds of professional Mac apps**

## 🎉 Final Checklist

Before releasing to Gumroad:
- [ ] Generate Sparkle signing keys
- [ ] Add public key to Info.plist
- [ ] Save private key in secure vault
- [ ] Push appcast.xml to GitHub
- [ ] Test "Check for Updates" button
- [ ] Build and sign v1.0.0 release
- [ ] Upload to GitHub Releases
- [ ] Update appcast.xml with real values
- [ ] Test full update flow (v1.0.0 → v1.0.1)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Keep private key safe** - Lose it = can't sign future updates
2. **Test updates locally first** - Use `file://` URL in Info.plist
3. **Write good release notes** - Users see appcast.xml descriptions
4. **Increment version numbers** - Update CFBundleShortVersionString in Info.plist
